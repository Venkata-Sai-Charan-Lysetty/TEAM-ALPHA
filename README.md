# Unveiling Insights of Chicago Crimes

### Introduction: 
Chicago has been keeping track of its crime by the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Records, since the early 1900s. Unfortunately, the city's crime rate, especially violent crimes, is higher than the average in the United States. In 2016, Chicago was responsible for almost half of the increase in homicides nationwide, even though the overall crime rates in the country are relatively low. The exact reasons for the high crime numbers in Chicago are not well understood. 

### What is the issue of interest? 
Crime rates have been a big worry in the USA for a long time. For my final project, I picked a dataset that focuses on crimes in Chicago from 2001 until now. What makes this dataset interesting is that it provides real-time information about the crimes happening in the city, and it gets updated every day. I got this data from the official website of the city of Chicago, which has a lot of public datasets available. 

### Why is this issue important? 
I chose this dataset because it has a lot of information that helps us understand and make sense of what's going on. There are many different aspects to look at, and we can discover interesting patterns and insights from it. The reason I picked Chicago is because it's known for having a high crime rate compared to other cities in Illinois. It's important to study and understand these patterns to find ways to make our communities safer and rapid service of emergency services within the crime area.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises over 7.62 million reported crimes in Chicago from 2001 to the present, excluding murders. It includes various attributes such as date, type of crime, location description, district, longitude, latitude, and whether an arrest was made. The dataset's primary focus is on Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) codes, enabling comprehensive categorization of criminal incidents.
